* Let's look at some code...
* What was the formula again?
* Let's create a series of approximations
* The square root of 5!
Amazing! :O
* This code has useful stuff in it!
* Iterators are always pointed at when talking about FP
* My first trait!  ~Iterable~
 - This trait models something which can be iterated.
 - It's entirely pure.
 - When you call next you get a new iterator.
* Iterating over approximations of square root
* Using std::iter
* ~within~ & ~relative~ again
* Here they are in the wild
* I couldn't get this to work
 - We need a copy of an infinite iterator!?
 - I couldn't:
   - clone;
   - box;
   - copy;
* Slope of a function ~f~ at a point
* Infinite series of approximations
* We can re-use the within and relative functions!
* Eliminate error
* See it run!
